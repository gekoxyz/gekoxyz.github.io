A few days ago Apple released its new invites [app](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/introducing-apple-invites-a-new-app-that-brings-people-together/).

Obviously we all know that, like with iMessage, they are trying to lock in people even more in their ecosystem, but this app release made me think about social media and how it brings people together.

I don't really like using social networks nowadays.
I just use TikTok, but I use it just to watch funny/entertaining content when I am bored and can waste a bit of time.
I wouldn't describe TikTok as a social network tho, at least not in the way I use it.
It doesn't get me to know what my friends are doing, just what somebody else cat is doing.
It's like YouTube, but dumber and more addicting, which is not good, I know, it's just that in this period I'm using it.
I think I could stop anytime, which is the same thing an addict would say.

But let's focus on "real" social networks.

X is pure engagement farming, content isn't that good, and comments are really, really bad. I had hopes for long videos, but I feel like noone is using them.
At least you can set the feed to include only people you follow, that's the only feature I really miss from X on other socials.

I will not consider Facebook and Snapchat, since the few times I open Facebook with my fake account to check things I can't see without being logged in I feel like the dead Internet theory is real, and Snapchat isn't really used that much in Italy.
But lately I've been appreciating the complexity of Facebook. Groups were a good thing, events were great (and you wouldn't have to use an app made by Apple to try to gatekeep you in...).
Basically the problem with Facebook are the users, which are now moving (tbh I think they already did) to Instagram.
And I think this is part of the problem with content downfall on Instagram.

I don't really know if Instagram or BeReal disappointed me the most.

Instagram... well we all know what's the point with instagram.
In the beginning there were just posts, and it was fine, then they added stories by copying Snapchat, and we all made fun of Zuck, but in the end it was a decent idea since now stories are the only thing I check when I use Instagram.
But then reels came. What a disaster.
I can't really explain it, but i feel like after reels the downfall has been really steep.
Reels are a lottery, and I can't figure out what it's based on. Some time ago I used to say that people used reels to little, and that they had to just use them more to tune the algorithm.
But that's not true. I used them a lot, since somebody at Instagram decided that it was a good thing to aggressively push reels on people's feeds, so that they could get people locked in faster and for longer.
They are just bad.

When I leave TikTok now sometimes I feel like I wasted time
With reels I also feel like I watched horrible content.
But some people get good reels, idk why, TikTok just picks it up faster.
I heard various things about this.
People say that Instagram is trying not to be that addictive (lol) and others say that they collect less usage data, so their model is worse.

Let's go to the final one, the one which promised us to defeat them, and just became one of them: BeReal.
Cool concept, poor execution, and the reason is very simple: you had to be real.
People didn't really want to do that. It's fine when you've got few friends, but when you start to add people you don't really consider friends I think you start to plan more what you post, to try to seem real.
But in reality, if you have to do the third BeReal in three days at the bathroom, or while you are doing nothing I think you get ashamed and don't really want to do that.
So you "save" the BeReal for later, and then post a picture that could have easily been an Instagram story.
But now people start to prepare stories as if they were posts so...

But let's try to go towards my point.

Instagram is not a social network. It's not about friends.
Even if i follow just my really close friends (which many people nowaways do with a "spam"/secondary account, and I've tried that) in my feed of 5 posts 2 are reels from people I don't follow (and we already know my problem with reels), 2 are posts from pepole I don't follow and that I don't care about, and 1 is finally either something I like/find interesting or something from someone I follow.
The ratio is horrible.
So basically now I use Instagram just to get up to date with friends by watching the stories they post, and then try to exit really fast without watching reels or stupid sponsored posts.

So in a sense I feel that stories are becoming the new posts, both for the way I use them and for how much I feel people prepair the content they post on stories.
Often I've seen people do a whole photoshoot and ask "which one should I post on my stories?".
I mean... WHAT. In 24 hours it will be gone forever if you don't choose to put it in your pinned stories (which just the fact that you can pin some content that would have been temporary is an indicator that I'm right in thinking that stories are the new posts, and the fact that now they are integrated in the feed is even more of an indicator).

By writing this I start to feel like the problem is the users.
People don't want social media, they just want to build an idealized avatar of themselves, or just a really pretty and refined photobook, but filled to the brim with ads.
And that's a thing I don't really care about.
